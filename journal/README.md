# DaVinci Resolve, The Ultimate Editing Software
### by Brandon Henman 3/14/25


Last year, I hit a breaking point with Adobe [Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html). For my daily video work. I was constantly switching between separate adobe apps just to get through a single project. Color correction in Lumetri, audio in Audition, and any visual effects in After Effects. This fragmented experience overloaded my focus and created a clunky, inconsistent user journey. I wasn’t just frustrated with performance—I was frustrated with the user experience design itself.

When I transitioned to [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve), I immediately noticed how it was built from the ground up with UX principles in mind. Everything I needed was consolidated into a single, unified interface editing, color, audio, effects, and export all inside one environment. This reflects the UX principle of minimizing **cognitive load**, as the system reduced the number of tools I had to manage and let me stay in the same zone.

To illustrate, here’s a breakdown of how I edited a recent client video using Resolve:

I began in the Cut page to quickly select my best takes. The interface offered large, visual previews and accessible tools, which supported the principle of **recognition over recall**. I didn’t need to remember where tools were icons, shortcuts, and smart panels made options visible at all times.

Then I moved into the Edit page. Its layout matched my existing **mental model** of a traditional non-linear editor: timeline at the bottom, preview monitor top right, media pool to the left. The tools were where I expected them to be, unlike Premiere where I often had to dig through nested panels and dropdowns.

In the Color page, I used Resolve’s node-based system to isolate skin tones, balance exposure, and apply stylistic LUTs. Initially, the node graph seemed complex, but the logical structure aligned with how I conceptualize visual adjustments. Each node offered clear, visual **feedback**, showing the result of each action instantly—no hidden layers, no trial-and-error toggling.

The Fairlight page gave me professional audio tools without needing to exit or relink files. I adjusted EQ and compressed dialogue using live meters and visual overlays, providing immediate system **feedback**. Again, this avoided mental back-and-forth between apps, which had previously caused mistakes and frustration.

Finally, exporting on the Deliver page was simple. Presets were clearly labeled with icons and descriptions, reducing the risk of choosing the wrong settings—another example of **recognition over recall** in action.

What makes Resolve truly shine is its consistency across modules. Each page is tailored to a phase of post-production, but all share a unified design language. This consistency supports learnability, helping users build accurate mental models that transfer across tasks. It also makes the interface more predictable, reducing the need for relearning when switching between color and audio work.
